Tutorial from: https://guides.github.com/features/pages/

I added this README so that you can read something. Nothing of value was created by adding this file and your time was wasted by reading a meaningless description about a meaningless repository. Its a tutorial I followed, nothing more. Hopefully you aren't reading this anymore after I told you that, but if you still want to read something I suggest wikipedia for text about stuff.
